        <h2>THE FIRST MENTALITY</h2>
        <P class="rcc">A major part of first is having good sportmanship and helping others. this is defined as gracious professionalism
            and coopertition. gracious professionalism and not just an idea, but rather a way of life for all first teams.
            whether you are on the field, in the stands, or anywhere outside the competition enviroment, first teams are 
            encouraged to be kind to and supportive of everyone on their taem and on others.
            gracious professionals in competition are like two friends in the same race: each wants the other to 
            succeed, but that doesn't subtract from their desire to win, gracious professionalism involves improving 
            society through teaching and encouraging others, as giant, complex, machine. coopertition is major part of first 
            and even some of the games, coopertition means helping a struggling teammate. it is working with others
            to solve problems. it is also learning from others and respecting their opinions. by coopertition, not only
            is everyone happier, but they are also more productive. it takes a true leader to remain calm and encouraging 
            while still trying to win, which is the essence of coopertition, and why it is a core value of first.

           <img src="images/bio_kamen.jpg" height="200px">
           <p class="rcc"> Dean Kamen founded FIRST Robotics to get student interested in the world of Science
               and Technology. he started out as an inventor, just trying  to help solve regular problems with out-of-the-box
               solutions. he invented many useful things such as the insulin pump, water purification systems, and the segway PT.
               the idea behind his company did extremely well. he even says that first is the invention he is most proud of.
               Another playmaker of first Robotics was the late woodie flowers (1943-2019),a mechanical engineer 
               and co-founder of first . he was a prominent member of the first community and created the woodie 
               flowers award, given to one mentor for outstanding contribution to the students on their team.
